# RFM_analysis
SuperStore company is a global retail company. Therefore, the company has a lot of customers. On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing department wants to run marketing campaigns to show appreciation to customers who have supported the company over time. Also, they want to target potential customers to become loyal customers. However, the Marketing department has not yet segmented each customer of this year because the dataset is too large to be processed manually like in previous years. Therefore, they asked the Data Analysis department to support them in implementing a customer segmentation problem to deploy suitable marketing programs for each customer group. The Marketing Director also proposed using the RFM model. However, previously, when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify using excel. Currently, the data volume is too large, so the Data department is expected to build a deployment stream to evaluate Segmentation through Python programming. Proposed approach:

- Prepare a dataset suitable for the RFM model.
- Determine how to calculate and calculate the R, F, M scores for each customer. Note: R index date is calculated on December 31, 2017.
- Provide a way to calculate the corresponding scores on a scale from 1 to 5. Hint: use the quintile method of Statistics.
- Group each customer based on the classification table.
- Visualize the quantity of each segment with different data dimensions.
- Analyze the current situation of the company and provide suggestions to the Marketing team.
- Suggest to the Marketing and Sales team which of the three R, F, M indices is most important for the Superstore company's retail model
